Device Specifications
---------------------
Device specifications are used to capture characteristics of a given hardware configuration. 
This is not necessarily a one-to-one mapping to a part number or SKU since some peripheral 
devices may have been added or certain characteristics upgraded. A device specification 
contains a reference to a hardware asset which provides the basic information about the 
hardware including name, description, image URL, etc.

A device specification contains a list of commands that may be invoked by SiteWhere on the 
device. It is perfectly acceptable for two device specifications to point to the same asset 
type, but have a different set of commands, reflecting different configurations of the given 
device.
