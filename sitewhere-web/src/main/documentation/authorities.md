Granted Authorities
===================
Granted authorities are permissions assigned to users to allow access to
various pieces of system functionality. When creating a user, a list of
granted authorities are chosen based on their expected needs in the
system.

Granted authorities are used to restrict access to the REST services. Each
REST call must include basic authentication information associated with a
system user. Based on the authorities associated with the user, certain
REST methods may or may not be available.
