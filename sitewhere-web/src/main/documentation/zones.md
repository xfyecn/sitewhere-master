Zones
=====
Zones are user-defined geospatial areas that carry special meanings in IoT applications. 
For instance, in an airport, there are secure areas where only certain personnel should 
be allowed. In an application that monitors airport security, it makes sense to be able 
to fire an alert if an unauthorized person enters a secure zone.
